TL;DR:  I'm pretty sure we can deliver bleeding-edge updates to your MK devices soon, and with a little work, the rest of the stack, and even coordination, too.

I'm checking out cloud-based, multi-arch CI w/auto-deploy to every smart device you own, comparing now 1/2 dozen alternatives (me IQ 60, so me took six times to learn).  Mind-blowing, the offerings on the cloud, all free for open-source.  POCs for local Docker containers incl. qemu-arm, hub.docker.com-built images also qemu-arm through a clever trick found by my Filipino friend (Machinekit RPi port maintainer).  resin.io SDCard images for BBB + RPi, Yocto host runs hard-RT kernel + Machinekit in Debian chroot, pushed to registered devices with 'git push', plus a few competitors, my head's exploding.

The real vindication for the anarchist in me, patents are already practically obsolete.  I'm sharp + know my IT, but one simply can't just live in a hole for 1-2 years without emerging to find how many cloud companies have filled whatever exact tiny niche I'm shopping for, and all are 2-guy garage operations, wha tha faaaaa????  Obama pushes free Internet for all citizens, and the playing fields are suddenly orders of magnitude more level compared to feudal or industrial periods.  The ferment will have been so hot that evolution (aka 'prior art') has washed past you even in the time it takes to get provisional patent status.

Compare that to 20 years ago, the M$ FUD clearly (in  20+20 hindsight) proved they felt defensive back then.  Today Yamin asked whether they have a mobile OS offering, yes!, and what's it called, uhh....<blank/>   And BAH HAH today I browse upon M$'s John Gossman today kowtowing to Linux:

Hey, we're also looking for a JS crackerjack (crackpots OK too) to plumb some hardware control UIs through the cloud.
