    “We have strategically partnered with Docker because Microsoft is
    investing in freedom of choice for developers. We believe that
    Docker’s orchestration services APIs offer a flexible way to build,
    deploy and manage highly available, distributed applications built for
    Linux containers —and when available—Windows Server containers that
    are freely portable between any host infrastructure. We are excited
    about the Docker Machine Management API support for Azure as part of
    the Alpha release.” – John Gossman, architect, Microsoft Azure
