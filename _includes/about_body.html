      <h1>Design, Build, Deploy and Manage</h1>

      Today, your hardware is only as valuable as the software that
      controls it, but software only grows more and more complex. We
      want to help you in all areas of managing your software:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Design your software with cutting edge machine control
	  technology and flexible, intuitive user interfaces.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Select and configure the best software building blocks, and
	  develop custom hardware and software interfaces.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Build and deploy the entire software stack, from the
	  application and operating system on the device itself to
	  cloud services and mobile apps in the users' hands.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Manage your devices: software updates, monitoring,
	  management information collection and user support.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Machine Control and Automation</h1>

      Your machine needs the best control system. It may have numerous
      switch, sensor and encoder inputs. It may produce coordinated
      motion in motorized joints or talk to devices attached by field
      buses. Interconnecting these hardware components to perform
      accurately, efficiently and safely requires software components:
      logic gates, PLC functions, PID controllers, or even a complex
      motion controller.

      We can help integrate your machine controls, and give you the
      power to do it yourself with tools intuitive to those with
      electronics backgrounds: programming optional. In the rare case
      you need custom components not available out of the box, we can
      help develop those.

      <h1>Accessible Anywhere</h1>

      Universal access has never been in greater demand. Do your users
      want to:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Schedule their morning espresso brew from a smart phone?
	</li>
	<li>
	  Maintain control of a 20 ton CNC machine tool with a tablet
	  even when stepping away from the main operator panel?
	</li>
	<li>
	  Analyze real-time production throughput data from a laptop
	  on the road?
	</li>
      </ul>
      We make access easy, whether on the LAN or the cloud,
      whether on a mobile device or a PC, and on all popular
      hardware and operating systems.
