	Well, I didn't vote for you. Listen. Strange women lying in
	ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of
	government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate
	from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. You
	don't vote for kings. Shut up! Will you shut up?! I am your
	king. I'm not a witch.

	Burn her! You don't vote for kings. Well, what do you want? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. I'm not a witch.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Well, how'd you become king, then?</li>
        <li>Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!</li>
      </ul>

	And the hat. She's a witch! Why? Shut up! I have to push the pram a lot.

	Did you dress her up like this? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in
	the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of
	the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to
	carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Burn her anyway! Well,
	what do you want?
