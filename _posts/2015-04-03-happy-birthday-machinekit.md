A year ago today, [Michael Haberler][], [Charles Steinkuehler][],
[Kent Reed][], [Alexander Rössler][] and I finally haggled out the
final wording on the
[Machinekit project announcement][] email. As
Michael clicked the `Send` button, we had no idea what to expect.
Would anyone join our project, or would we hear only the sound of
crickets?

Looking back, the first year has been incredible beyond anything I
dared to hope for. In the next few days, check back for new articles
talking about the year's highlights and discuss some reasons the
project has been so successful. But before anything else, I want to
say,

## Happy Birthday Machinekit!

I'm just incredibly proud to be involved with a project like this.
