[Machinekit][mk] packages for Jessie, x86 architectures, are available
in the [Dovetail Automata package repository][mkio-debs].

<!---more--->

For Beaglebone, Machinekit is still waiting on kernel packages, coming
soon.

Follow the [usual instructions][mkio-debs], replacing `wheezy` with
`jessie` as needed.  The instructions will be updated soon.

With these Buildbot updates, Machinekit will now be regularly tested
on Jessie in the same way it has been for Wheezy.
