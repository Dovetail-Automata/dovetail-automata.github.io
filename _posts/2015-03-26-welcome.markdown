Dovetail Automata LLC is happy to have our new site online.

The site is written with [Jekyll] and hosted on [GitHub Pages].
[Rod Fitzsimmons Frey] helped out with the web design (and I've
barbered his good work since), and [Alexander Rössler] created the
site's logos. It's no mistake that all these characteristics are
shared with the [Machinekit] project!
