            <p>Well, I didn't vote for you. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. You don't vote for kings. Shut up! Will you shut up?! I am your king. I'm not a witch.</p>
            <h2>Sets The Cinema Back 900 Years!</h2>
            <p>Burn her! You don't vote for kings. Well, what do you want? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. I'm not a witch.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Well, how'd you become king, then?</li>
                <li>Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Help, help, I'm being repressed!</h3>
            <p>And the hat. She's a witch! Why? Shut up! I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
            <h4>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h4>
            <p>Did you dress her up like this? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Burn her anyway! Well, what do you want?</p>
